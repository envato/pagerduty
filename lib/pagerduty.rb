  # Send PagerDuty a trigger event to report a new or ongoing problem. When
  # PagerDuty receives a trigger event, it will either open a new incident, or
  # add a new trigger log entry to an existing incident, depending on the
  # provided incident_key.
  #
  # @param [String] description A short description of the problem that led to
  #   this trigger. This field (or a truncated version) will be used when
  #   generating phone calls, SMS messages and alert emails. It will also appear
  #   on the incidents tables in the PagerDuty UI. The maximum length is 1024
  #   characters.
  #
  # @option options [String] :incident_key Identifies the incident to which
  #   this trigger event should be applied. If there's no open (i.e. unresolved)
  #   incident with this key, a new one will be created. If there's already an
  #   open incident with a matching key, this event will be appended to that
  #   incident's log. The event key provides an easy way to "de-dup" problem
  #   reports. If this field isn't provided, PagerDuty will automatically open a
  #   new incident with a unique key.

  #   triggering this event.
  #
  # @option options [String] :client_url The URL of the monitoring client that
  #   is triggering this event.

  #   like included in the incident log.
